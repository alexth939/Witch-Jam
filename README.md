# Witch-Jam
 A shameless show-off repo. Just two devs, two days, and way too much coffee.

### Rules:

- All contributions must be made via **pull requests**.
To begin working, create your personal branch named like this:
`dev_your_name_in_camel_case_or_with_underscores_if_needed`.
- The project contains a large collection of assets. **Do not reference them directly!**
If you want to use a new or existing asset, copy it into an appropriate subfolder inside `Assets/Playground`.
- To keep the project **portable**, all work must be confined to `Assets/Playground`.
- Do not use Unity's default generated assemblies or editor assemblies.
Instead, create your own assembly definitions.
Recommended approach: one assembly per minigame.
Exception: shared or common code may have its own shared assembly.

## Minigames:

### Bomberman

...

### Pipes Runner

...

### Zuma

...

### Platforms Jumper

...

### Plants vs Zombies
